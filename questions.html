@channel your questions and what they are looking for in terms of an answer

Q1- How will you plan your website? What is your website about? Who is the intended audience? 

Q2- Method- could be that to complete the website it needs to be uploaded, so you are using GitHub to publish it, which will allow others to interact with it 
       Skill- could mention planning and are using Trello to properly plan your website, could also mention your skill with HTML and CSS  
       Resources- Did you look at websites similar to yours to get inspiration? Did you use  W3Schools to further your knowledge, did you watch any YouTube videos? 

Q3- It specifically wants you to speak about GDPR and Copyright, but please don’t just copy and paste from a website, try to re-word it in your own words. What is copyright? What would be the repercussions if you broke copyright law? For GDPR, what would you need to follow in order to take people’s emails / personal information (for example if you were using a mailing list)?
@channel Question 3 needs a reference

Q4- Review the things you’ve used for making the website, for example VSCode, Trello, GitHub etc. Write some positives and negatives about everything you’ve used. 

Q5- How are you going to test your website? Perhaps mention using live-server, that you personally have checked all links work etc. The files used have been HTML and CSS as they are standard. Could also mention using JPG’s or PNG’s (image files), have you used any videos etc? For accessibility, mention how for all of your images you used the “alt” attribute to make your website more accessible for those with visual impairments as they may use a screen reader. Perhaps mention the fonts you chose were specifically chosen so they are easy to read for people with dyslexia etc, the colours you used weren’t too busy on the eyes. 

Q6- If you were to do this again how would you improve? Would you take more breaks away from the computer? Would you change the environment you were working in (was it too loud, the light too dim etc?), would you plan in more detail next time? 

Q7- Easier to do on Friday (or whenever your website is complete). Describe your website as if you are speaking to someone who can’t see it; what pages do you have on there? What can be found on each page? Write some positives and negatives of your website, are you happy with what you made? What were your strengths and weaknesses? Do you feel you achieved what you set out to achieve with your answer to question 1? 

Q8- Need to upload 2 screenshots of your website in 2 browsers, do this on Friday as we need your website to be uploaded to GitHub to do it.

<p>Upon his death in his adopted home of Los Angeles, California, in the summer of 1951, the majority of the music-appreciating world breathed a collective sigh of relief. The bogeyman of 20th Century music was no more: It was safe once again to open one's ears. Seventy years on and still, today, he is generally viewed as having been the most unwelcome of unwelcome visitors, a coldly calculating elitist who took music apart and singularly failed ever to properly put it back together again. In the eyes (and to the ears) of a great many listeners Arnold Schönberg never created a single piece of music worthy of the name. And yet ...</p>

<p>"I am not ambitious. I do not expect people to understand my music at the first hearing. I am content if they do not dislike it when they hear it for the fifteenth time." - Arnold Schönberg
</p>

<p>Arnold Schönberg. Born in Vienna on the September 13 1874 to Samuel and Pauline Schönberg, owners of a shoe shop.</p>

<p>"As a child of less than nine years, I had started composing little and later larger pieces for two violins in immitation of such music as I used to play with my teacher. Decisive progress took place when, a few years later, I found a classmate who posessed a viola and could play it. At once, I started writing trios for two violins and viola. Next, with the money I had earned from teaching German to a Greek, I bought, second-hand, a few scores of Beethoven; from this minute, I was posessed by an urge to write string quartets. In the meantime, Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, an encyclopedia which we bought on instalments, had reached the long hoped for letter 'S', enabling me to learn under 'Sonata' how a first movement of a string quartet should be constructed."</p>

<p>As a composer, Schönberg was in the main self taught. However he did take some lessons from a musician of his own generation, the composer Alexander von Zemlinsky</p>

<p>"I had been a Brahmsian, when I met Zemlinsky. His love embraced both Brahms and Wagner and soon after I became an equally confirmed addict. No wonder that the music I composed at that time mirrored the influence of both these masters."</p>

<p>Schönberg worked first in a bank. To his delight, the bank went bust and he was able to turn to music, doing any kind of odd job in the world of operetta and popular musical theatre: copying, arranging, orchestrating. In 1901, he married his teacher's sister, Mathilda von Zemlinsky, and moved to Berlin. There, he became music director of a so-called intellectual cabaret, "Die Uberbrettel". Still, hack work was the only real source of money and after two years he returned to Vienna. In 1903 he began a lifetime of teaching. Vienna had always treated its artists very shabily and at the same time prided itself on being the centre of a great musical tradition: Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Bruckner and, more recently, Hugo Wolf and, of course, Gustav Mahler.</p>

<p>The music of this time is what we call 'late romanticism', but late romanticism isn't just, as the cliche has it, a sort of musical decadence, a glorious twighlight before the ravages of the First World War, it was also a period pulsating with musical ideas; new things were being discovered, traditional forms were being discarded; artistically speaking it was a curiosly happy time in many ways because the highest musical standards were combined with a quantam leap forward in new inventiveness. It was against this background that Schönberg was working.</p>

<p>Vienna in the first decade of the 20th Century was the capital of a rapidly decaying Empire ruled over by a senile Emperor, Franz-Josef. It's society was politically stagnent and socially rigid; everywhere there was a fierce resistence to new experience. And yet, in the midst of all this, there flourished a small, active, radical intelegencia drawn largely from the despised Jewish middle class. Schönberg mixed with a number of people who were equally important, at that time, in their own fields. Developments were taking place on a wide front, so to speak: Vienna was not only the birthplace of modern psycoanalysis, but there were also far reaching developments in archictecture, in literature and in other fields such as science. It was a period of enormous fertility, standing in direct paradox to a situation which was rapidly deterriating in the sort of end, loomomg more and more ominously into society. The living conditions for many of these intellectuals could hardly be said to ahve been luxurious; they lived either in tiny flats or in rented rooms and so the Vienesse coffee houses became their home from homes, where, each day, for the price of a cup of coffee, one could read the newspappapers of virtually the entire world. It is no exageration to say that many importatnt works were produced on the coffe house tables of Vienna! The Schönberg circle met at the 'Cafe Museum', a building designed by the Vienesse architect Adolf Loos, which meant that there was a whole coterie of Loos pupils there and at that coffee house there was a cultural overkill at that particular period.</p>

<p>"We conducted or needed to conduct our lives in a way befitting national heroes; we showed a better regard for the past than did its traditional protectors;culture enabled us to think on: we had a heritage to preserve and we knew instinctively that a thing either grows or dies. </p>

<p>Who were these heroes of whom Schönberg writes? There was Siegmund Freud, the founder of modern psyciatry; painters such as Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, the aforementioned architecht Loos and, in literature, there was Karl Kraus. Kraus, in particular, came from a similar position as that of Schönberg, one of radicalism in the service of a conservative mentality. Krauss believed that the world was going to the dogs because of the misuse of language; for him the emergence of the cliche in conversation and of the easy phrase in journalism would assuredly bring the world to a speedy end. And in may ways he was right, because when the war came, before a single shot had been fired, there was an intense non-stop barage of phraseology. Loos, too, had his similarities to Schönberg. Just as Schönberg was a composer of music all too infrequently performed, so Loos was an architect whose buildings emerged only after enormous intervals. He was a man of grandiose projects and of even grander theories, a pioneer of the idea that architecture was not just a series of walls, but a way of life. This was the strange conpendium of which Schonberg was a part: a sort of youmg Jewish intelegincia of the time, who in their cultural eminations were ecstatic, fin du Mondish, aware of catastrophies.
</p>

<p>"When I had finished my Chamber Symphony, op. 9, I told my friends, 'Now I have established my style; I now know how I have to compose.' But my next work showed a great deviation from this style; the supreme commander had ordered me on a harder road."
</p>

<p>The years between 1907 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 were a period of frenzied activity for Schönberg, as indeed they were for the likes of James Joyce in literature and for Picasso and Braque in painting. In these years he moved very rapidly from a compositional style which still to some extent resembled that of late romanticism into areas which were, as he described them himself, entirely new and unprecidented. The most prominent musical development was in the area of harmony. In his earlier works, although he was breaking out at the seams, Schönberg was still writing in a style which was basically comprehensible to followers of late !9th Century music, but all kinds of new things had developed: the whole tone scale, chords built of non conventional intervals, such as forths and fifths, had taken their place and were combined with the traditional repertoire of chords to create a much richer and more varied and, at the same, less predictable style. And, in the Second String Quartet in F-sharp, which Schönberg wrote in 1907, now, for the first time, Schönberg wanted it to be recognised that a piece of music could survive by being simply a construction of chords which did not owe allegience to some central key signature. This isn't a purely technical idea, it's also a search for a different kind of expression; at this time he was very well aware that he was moving forward, forward into wholly uncharted territory.</p>

<p>"Now, however, that I have definately started upon my journey, I may confess to having broken off the bonds of a bygone aesthetic, and if I'm striving towards a goal that seems to me to be certain, nevertheless I already feel the opposition that I shall have to overcome.</p>

<p>"The fourth movement begins with an introduction depicting the departure from earth to another planet. The visionary poet here foretells the sensations which soon perhaps will be confirmed by reality: escaping from gravitation; passing through clouds into thinner and thinner air; forgetting all the troubles of life on earth - that is what is attempted in this introduction."</p>

<p>In the Second String Quartet there was another startling innovation: the introduction of the human voice into the last two movements. In the fourth and final movemnt she sings words by the poet Stefan George. The opening words of George's poem have come to define Arnold Schönberg's entire ouvre: "Ich fühle luft von anderem planeten." (I feel air from another planet).</p>

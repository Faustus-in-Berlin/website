    <h3>The Case for the Prosecution</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>"Schönberg is one of the extremists; here cacophony is elevated to a law … After all, there is an aesthetics of the hideous" - Signale Newspaper, Berlin 29.05.1907</p>
    <p>"For me, however, his thought belongs to fin de siècle romanticism and the decadence of the 90s, and therefore looks backward rather than forward" - Edmund Rubbra, 1951</p>
    <p>"Schönberg meant nothing to me. But, as he apparently meant a lot to a lot of other people, I dare say it is all my own fault." - Ralph Vaughan Williams, 1951</p>
    <p>"Atonalism appears to be a cul-de-sac, cluttered up with morbid growths emanating from the brains rather than from the imagination of a few decadent, Central European Jews." - Sir Arnold Bax, 1949 </p>

    <h3> <br><br> The Case for the Defence</h3>

    <p>His tunes aren't as whistlable as those penned by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, and his orchestration isn't as lush as that of Richard Strauss; none of his works are as wildly characteristic as the Rite of Spring, nor could they be said to be evocative in quite the same way as La Mer is evocative. So why Schönberg? Why does this figure, a cause of so much fuss in his lifetime and so much trouble to players and listeners alike, a name that still, more than seventy years on from his death, strikes fear into audiences, continue to preoccupy us to such an extent and why does he continue to play such an important part in the thinking of musicians and of writers about music and, in fact, in the thinking of all those concerned with the music of this century and the last? This is the question that this website is seeking to answer!</p>
    I don't think it is likely that it is possible to convince people who find the music extremely difficult that hidden beneath the surface is a heart of gold and that it's really all like Puccini if you only know how to listen to it - it isn't like that, it isn't like that at all! This was a fractious and difficult personality blessed (or maybe cursed) with a singularly fearless (or sometimes simply ferocious) intellect, someone who believed himself charged with a unique responsibility towards music, towards musicians and students of music all through his life, a life of perpetual struggle, a struggle to keep his family in the most basic way and a struggle to achieve his own difficult conception of what music was and had to be. He was also a painter of no little distinction, but they're not the kind of paintings you'd wish to hang above your fireplace: they stare out at you with black eyes and with frightened faces suggesting some terrible impending catastrophe, and, indeed, at the time at which he painted them, the Empire to which he belonged, was heading (sleepwalking) towards total and utter catastrophe: War was about to engulf the composer and his world, a war that would wipe the Austro-Hungarian Empire itself off the map.</p>
    Schönberg wanted to be a composer of new music and, at one and the same time, to be a guardian of the old language, and in the dark years through which he lived, in the worst years of his life, he was more and more obsessed with the idea that it was men like him who carried a flame, a tiny light, through this darkness. Above all, music had to tell the truth, and the truth, for Schönberg, often distorted the conventional picture of pleasant music: if a composer were able to write very pleasant music to appeal instantly to his public, all well and good; he'd be fêted by society without any difficulties and his bank balance would reap the rewards, but, if these become mere empty formulas, then they are nothing more than a reflection of an empty and bankrupt society. Schönberg felt, as many other important artists felt, but none so stridently and none so pointedly as he, that many of the old forms of music making were dying; he was not only a victim, as English music critics used to say, of Central European hysteria, he was rather a thinker of the calibre of someone like Wittgenstein or like Russell, a man who reacted to the world around him and tried, as honestly as he could, to portray this in his music. And this is the thing that makes him perhaps the greatest and certainly the most influential figure of 20th Century music and also the thing which, above all, I hope, we (you!) will come to admire.</p>
